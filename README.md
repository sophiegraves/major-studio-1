## Qual Visualization Sketches

### Option 1: Postal Palette 
Using data from the National Postal Gallery's collection of stamps, including ink color, year, and value (in cents).
The visual will include a rectangular area chart, with sub rectangles representing each ink color in the collection, and dimensions based on the number of stamps or stamp sheets in the collection with that particular ink color. Each rectangle will have the visual of a stamp that specific color. When clicking a particular color rectangle, it will open a pop-up that shows a breakdown of additional data - including the total number of stamps/stamp sheets in the collection, average value, and a frequency bar chart of year that stamps of that color were issued.

### Option 2: Carats of Color
Using data from the National Museum of Natural History's Minerals department, looking specifically at their collection of gems (n=300) - using color descriptions, weight in carats, and type of gem. The visual will include a rectangle area chart, with each rectangle representing a specific color gem, and area representing total weight in carats of all gems of that color. However, descriptions of gem colors are often specific (e.g. "very dark green"), so clicking on a specific color will expand that color into its own rectangular area chart, breaking down all of the gems of that color into sub-catgories, with area still based on carat weight. Then, clicking on those sub-categories will open up a pop-up with info on specific types of gems that color, number of gems that type in the collection, average carat weight, and (space allowing) an image representing that type of gem.

### Option 3: Describing the Unknown
Using data from the Smithsonian's collection of paintings - filtered by searching for <i>"Portrait of a" </i> (which are all unidentified sitters, as far as I've seen), and looking specifically at the words (nouns, adjectives, verbs) used to describe the portrait in its plate description, to see if there are any nuances in how men and women are described if identity is unknown (i.e. whoever wrote the description can't say anything about who the person featured is or what that person's done, because they don't know who it is). The visual will feature a sunburst chart, with the inner-most circle representing incidence of unidentified men vs. unidentified women with descriptions in the collection. From there, the words will be broken down into theme (things like attire, expression, occupation, setting, etc.) and then further broken down into sub-category (e.g. attire broken down in to "hats," "jewelry," etc.). From there, those sub-categories will be clickable, and open a pop-up with images of the paintings that were described based on that sub-category.
